# Datastar SDK Reference Examples

These files are reference implementations from the official Datastar SDK. They demonstrate how the SDK is used in different environments:

- `deno.ts` - Example of using Datastar with Deno
- `node.js` - Example of using Datastar with Node.js

These examples are helpful for understanding how to:

1. Set up a server to handle Datastar requests
2. Read signals from requests
3. Generate Server-Sent Events (SSE) responses
4. Implement merge fragments functionality

## Implementation Notes

Our Bun SDK implementation follows similar patterns but optimizes for Bun's specific features and performance characteristics. Use these examples for reference, but note that our implementation may differ in specifics.

These were copied from the official Datastar repository for reference purposes.
