# Datastar Routes Examples

This directory contains Go implementation examples from the official Datastar repository. These files demonstrate various patterns and techniques for implementing Datastar functionality.

## Example Categories

These examples cover a wide range of use cases:

- **UI Patterns**: Click-to-edit, lazy loading, infinite scroll, progress bars, etc.
- **Form Handling**: Form validation, custom validity, file uploads, etc.
- **Data Management**: Signals, value bindings, bulk updates, etc.
- **Visual Effects**: Animations, view transitions, toggling visibility, etc.
- **Performance**: Lazy tabs, prefetching, polling, etc.
- **Security**: CSRF protection, etc.

## Implementation Notes

Even though these examples are written in Go, they provide valuable insights into the patterns and approaches that work well with Datastar. When implementing similar functionality in our Bun SDK, we can:

1. Study the server-side event generation patterns
2. Observe how different events are structured
3. Understand the expected client-server interaction flow
4. See how complex features like animations, lazy loading, etc. are implemented

These examples serve as a reference for porting functionality to our Bun SDK implementation.
